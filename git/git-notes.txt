What is a repository?
	A place where we can store things(ex google drive)

What is git?

	-edit things and tests a program before bringing it out to the front end
	-it allows us to share our files in a repository 

What is github?

Centralized vs Distributed VCS
	-Centralize VCS uses a central location to store all of the source code, data and records.
	Cons:
		The remote centralized location can go down and no one accesses it
		Losing internet at home or work
	-Distributed VCS creates a copy of the source code on each user's machine
	Pros:
		If you lose internet, you can still work on the source code locally
	
Coomon git commands:
	git init: creates a new git repo locally
	git add [FILENAME]: adds file to staging
		-git add . : adds all files from the current directory and children diretories
		-git add -a: adds all changes from any file in the repository to staging
	git commit -m "message": adds all changes that are in staging to an offical commit LOCALLY
	git push: sends latest commits from local repo to remote repo
	git pull: get latest commits from remote repo to local repo
	git status: view what is in staging
	git log: displays all commits
	git clone [Link]: get remote repo to local machine for the first time.
